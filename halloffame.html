                <p>AFSF's first ever Commanding Officer, Panterblack123, is someone I really admire. As some of you may know, he is extremely busy in his life as he has his own family to take care of. But yet, that did not stop him from his dedication towards AFSF. AFHC, especially Panter have contributed a lot to set up AFSF and get us open and running. I find it impressive considering that he also needs to lead other things as well. Without panter's contribution, AFSF and all of us wouldn't be here. With that, AFSF wish him the best in his life and in USAF. 🫡</p>

                <p>Although Iampro wasn't one of the most active AFSF members to the end, she was still a great help with the logistics field for AFSF. She helped with logging, hosting events, maintaining consistent activity at one point and just a great help with AFSF. I can remember when she was a part of the old Training Department and would host a lot. With over 3,714 message, it just shows how active she was in the AFSF community. It's sad to see Iampro go and I am happy to announce that she will go down in AFSF history as one of the best Commanders.</p>

                <h3>Former DD</h3>
                <p>Jetton was the Commander of AFSF from the third of Feb in 2023. He achieved the rank of Commander in the sixteenth of June, and finally the Deputy Director somewhere between July to September as records showed. He was a hard-working member of AFSF, and having created the recent EG unit, he was given a lot of adulation. In the second generation of AFSF, when panter was still the Director of AFSF, he helped many people with their needs and questions and created former units like AFSW and SERT. Even if they weren't very poplar, he was very active and hosted a memorable amount of flash inspections. He updated the old documents made by former Directorate members, and was given many medals for his hard work. He was friendly and always active. Unfortunately, with the downfall of AFSF’s activeness and the former elite unit disbanded, his resolve to continue leading this division was crushed and he discharged. Despite the challenges he faced these recent months, his legacy as a hardworking and respected Directorate member of the AFSF will endure.</p>

Me and xorph have essentially been through it all, becoming the 2ic and above within the Elite Guard (EG) before it changed to TRF. I was not here while he had ranked up to directorate, however Xorph was active as hell and a great person to be around during his occupation. He will be remembered in my heart as the best Director so far in AFSF's name.</p>

                <p>Udh was the former Deputy Director of AFSF. He has worked hard over the years it is sad to see him gone all because of one thing... He is honestly one of the best DD's. His activity kind of ruins it but he had a lot of passion for the position that he has managed to get to. He has helped me out over the few months I have been here. He stayed here during the rough times when EG got disbanded and AFSF was launched into a plunge of darkness, barely active. But with him being Deputy Director and also command before it is safe to say he has revived AFSF. O7 He will never be forgotten.</p>
